"""
Test class for all requisite Module08 functionality.

Instructions:
1) Rename 'testSomething()' method such that 'Something' is specific to your needs; add others as needed, beginning each method with 'test...()'.
2) Add the '@Test' annotation to each new 'test...()' method you add.
3) Import the relevant modules and classes to support your tests.
4) Run this class as unit test app.
5) Include a screen shot of the report when you submit your assignment.

Please note: While some example test cases may be provided, you must write your own for the class.
